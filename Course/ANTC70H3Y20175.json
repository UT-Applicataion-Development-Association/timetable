How and why have ethnographic methods become so central to anthropology, and what can we continue to learn with them? Students complement readings and lectures on theories and practices of ethnographic methods, both historical and contemporary, with exercises and assignments designed to provide first-hand experience in carrying out various techniques of ethnographic research. We also consider the unique ethical challenges of ethnographic methods and what it means to conduct ethically sound research.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Anthropology (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "ANTB19H3 and ANTB20H3 and at least 0.5 credit at the C-level in socio-cultural anthropology courses", "exclusions": "(ANTC60H3)", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2017 Summer Y", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["J Tremblay"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MW 110"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
