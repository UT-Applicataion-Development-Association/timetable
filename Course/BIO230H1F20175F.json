{"id": "BIO230H1F20175F", "code": "BIO230H1F2", "name": "From Genes to Organisms", "description": "The genome is the \"book of life,\" providing instructions to construct an organism. This course introduces genome biology and explores how the building blocks of life are networked into functioning organisms. We will investigate how cells perceive internal and external cues, how gene expression is shaped by this perception, and how these events give rise to tissues, organs, and whole organisms. (Lab Materials Fee: $20). Lab coat and safety glasses are required for use in laboratories; students are responsible for purchasing these items (approximate cost is $25).", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO130H1, (CHM135H1, CHM136H1)/(CHM138H1, CHM139H1)/CHM151Y1", "exclusions": "BIO240H1, BIO241H1, BIO250Y1, BIO255H1, BIO255Y1.
