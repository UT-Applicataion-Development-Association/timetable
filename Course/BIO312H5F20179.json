{"id": "BIO312H5F20179", "code": "BIO312H5F", "name": "Plant Physiology", "description": "This course will focus on the principal physiological processes in plants and their response to environmental factors and global change. By addressing factors involved in global change, including rising atmospheric CO2, alterations of the global nitrogen cycle and global climate warming, and examining their effects on photosynthesis and plant metabolism, the course will provide the basis to understand the implications of global change factors to plants, ecosystems and their impact on carbon sources and sinks in the modern biosphere.
