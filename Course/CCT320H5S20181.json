Students will critically assess how a wide variety of technological-mediated practices have brought about significant social changes by affecting community structures and notions of individual identity, facilitating cultural exchanges and misunderstandings, impacting public opinion, and enabling new modes of political organization and unrest. As part of that endeavour we will examine various theories of collective action, including collective behaviour theory, resource mobilization, new social movements, gift economies, and class struggle. These theoretical perspectives will be evaluated based on their potential to inform our understandings of historical and contemporary examples of communities of practice.
