It will survey a variety of interesting vision problems and techniques. Specifically, the course will cover image formation, features, object and scene recognition and learning, multi-view geometry and video processing. It will also feature recognition with RGB-D data. The goal of the class will be to grasp a number of computer vision problems and understand basic approaches to tackle them for real-world applications.
