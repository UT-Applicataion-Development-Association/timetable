The efficiency, accuracy and reliability of numerical algorithms for several classes of models will be considered. In particular, models involving least squares, non-linear equations, optimization, quadrature, and systems of ordinary differential equations will be studied.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Computer & Mathematical Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "CSCC37H3 and MATB24H3 and MATB41H3 and [CGPA 3.0 or enrolment in a CSC Subject POSt]", "exclusions": "(CSCC50H3), (CSCC51H3), CSC350H, CSC351H", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "AA 206"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "PO 101"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
