{"id": "ERS103H5F20179", "code": "ERS103H5F", "name": "Geology and Public Issues", "description": "\"Civilization exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice.\" (Will Durant, 1885-1981). Our life is totally dependent on our planet and on what she provides. This course is an overview of our relationship with Earth: how she supports us, how she affects us, and how we affect her. After a quick introduction to how Earth works, topics discussed will include volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, mineral, energy and water resources, weather and climate change. As citizens of the world, we are, and will increasingly be, required to make decisions about our relation with Earth: we need to be sufficiently informed to contribute to the consequent debates.
