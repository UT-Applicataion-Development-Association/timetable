The introduction of conceptual approaches, reflective writing on the artwork produced, and a new range of sculpture techniques and materials will augment the technical skills students acquired in Sculpture I (FAS248H5) and Sculpture II (FAS258H5). Illustrated presentations, short readings, visiting artist reviews, an exhibition review, artist presentation, and field trips to fabrication facilities and galleries will accompany the studio work over the two terms.
