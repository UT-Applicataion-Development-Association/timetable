{"id": "FAS448Y5Y20179", "code": "FAS448Y5Y", "name": "Individual Investigations in Sculpture", "description": "This course is a continuation of FAS348Y. Students produce a coherent body of work based on research and written proposals. In their artwork, students explore their own identity and work in the context of contemporary sculpture practices, acknowledging both a theoretical and historical framework. Students should become aware of the relationship between the production and presentation of artwork, and be able to identify the audience for and the specific context within which their artwork might be presented. Class includes lectures, presentations, critiques, workshops, and field trips to studios, galleries, and fabrication facilities.
