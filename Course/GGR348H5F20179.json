There will be a discussion of basic lake ecology, with emphasis on the unique characteristics of the Great Lakes. The course will examine the various stresses past, present and future (climate change, new chemicals) that have or could impact upon the Basin. The complex governance issues in the Basin (two countries, eight states, one province, hundreds of municipalities, First Nations) will be considered, along with the management programs put in place to deal with the effects of human activity on the ecosystem. The sustainability of the Great Lakes basin will also be discussed in the context of present and future stresses.
