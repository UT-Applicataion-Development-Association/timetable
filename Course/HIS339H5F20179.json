{"id": "HIS339H5F20179", "code": "HIS339H5F", "name": "Postwar Germany, 1945-present", "description": "This course will explore the history of Germany beginning in 1945. We will examine the evolution of Germany from a dictatorship to a divided state by looking at Allied Policies in the 1940s, the economic wonder of the 1950s, and the tensions between East and West Germany until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. This course will look at both East and West Germany's very different confrontations with the Nazi past, the student movement of the 1960s, domestic terrorism in the 1970s, the breakdown of communism in the 1980s, and the growing pains of reunification that exist to the present day. All of these developments will be seen through legal, political, cultural, and media trends.
