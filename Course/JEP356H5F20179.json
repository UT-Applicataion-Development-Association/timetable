{"id": "JEP356H5F20179", "code": "JEP356H5F", "name": "Environmental Justice", "description": "Environmental Justice is about the fair treatment of all people in the creation and implementation of environmental policies. It also provides a critical framework to analyze and understand inequalities of an environmental kind. These inequalities are often based around identities of race, class and gender, such that marginalized groups are made to bear the burden of environmental externalities like pollution. Why are First Nations in Canada less likely to have access to safe drinking water? Why are industrial plants often in low-income neighborhoods? After critical examinations of the theories and foundations of environmental justice, this course uses a case study approach to understanding the concepts and the ways in which it has shaped modern society.
