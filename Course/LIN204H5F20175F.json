{"id": "LIN204H5F20175F", "code": "LIN204H5F2", "name": "English Grammar I", "description": "Students will learn about fundamental grammatical concepts, focusing on the major grammatical categories in English and how they interact at the phrase level. They will be introduced to the main constituents of English sentences and learn about the basic relationship between tense, aspect, and modality. Students will learn to apply this knowledge as a tool to think analytically about English, evaluating various registers and styles, and gaining an awareness of their own style of speaking and writing. Depending on the instructor, this course may be delivered fully or partially online. Students are required to take the final exam at the UTM campus. Arrangements will be made for proctored exam writing for students who are registered at Ontario university locations outside of the GTA.\u00a0This course does not count towards the Linguistic Studies minor or major program.\u00a0[24L, 12T]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Language Studies", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "LIN204H1, LINB18H3", "level": 200, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2017 Summer F", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L9999", "instructors": ["E Suh"], "times": [], "size": 300, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 320"}], "size": 31, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0109", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 68400, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 360"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 1158"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 1158"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0105", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 360"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0106", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 340"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0107", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 360"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0108", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 68400, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 340"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T9997", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 26, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T9998", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 26, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T9999", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 26, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0110", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 320"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
