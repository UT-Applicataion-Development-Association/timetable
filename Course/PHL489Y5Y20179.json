{"id": "PHL489Y5Y20179", "code": "PHL489Y5Y", "name": "The Socrates Project", "description": "The Socrates Project (PHL489Y) is a full-year course with two components. First, you will serve as a TA for a section of PHL105Y. You will attend two 1-hour PHL105Y lectures each week, and teach one tutorial of 20-25 students, meeting with them for 1 hour each week. You will grade their papers, hold office hours, and meet with the relevant professor as needed. You will be paid for 100 hours of work each semester, for a total of 200 hours, at the current hourly wage for CUPE Unit 1. The second component of the course is a seminar component that meets once per week for 3 hours. Roughly 75% of the seminar will be devoted to more in-depth study of the topics taken up in the PHL105Y. You will write a seminar paper on one of these topics under the supervision of a UTM Philosophy faculty member working in the relevant area. You will also give an oral presentation on your topic to the seminar members. The remaining 25% of the seminar will focus on the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy, benchmark grading, and grading issues generally. Admittance to the Socrates Project is by application only.
