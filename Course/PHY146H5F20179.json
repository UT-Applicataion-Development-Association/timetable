{"id": "PHY146H5F20179", "code": "PHY146H5F", "name": "Principles of Physics I", "description": "The first physics course is for students intending to pursue any of the Physics or Astronomy programs and highly recommended for some of the other programs in the Department of Chemical and Physical Sciences. This course provides a rigorous introduction to the concepts, approaches and tools that physicists use to describe the physical world through the study of classical and modern mechanics. Topics include mathematical physics, kinematics and dynamics as well as conservation laws for energy and momentum. Special relativity will be introduced as a topic that successfully addresses problems that arose in classical mechanics.
