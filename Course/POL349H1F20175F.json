{"id": "POL349H1F20175F", "code": "POL349H1F2", "name": "Globalization and Urban Politics", "description": "This course examines urban politics in the context of globalization. With an understanding that urban politics is shaped by forces that are at once immediate and distant, it considers the local-global character of urban development, governance, planning, public policy, democracy, citizenship, and territoriality. Throughout the class we will assess the uneven nature of urbanization and urban society in a variety of sites in the global north and global south. The course will introduce students to different theoretical perspectives and will focus on a number of critical urban issues such as suburbanization, immigration, sustainability, and inequality.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Political Science", "prerequisites": "POL214Y1/POL214Y5/POLB50Y3/POL224Y1", "exclusions": "POL349Y1/POL346Y5", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Summer F", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["T Enright"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2125"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2125"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
