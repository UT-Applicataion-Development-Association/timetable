{"id": "PSYD16H3F20179", "code": "PSYD16H3F", "name": "Critical Analysis in Social Psychology", "description": "The development of social psychology is examined both as a discipline (its phenomena, theory, and methods) and as a profession. The Natural and Human Science approaches to phenomena are contrasted. Students are taught to observe the lived-world, choose a social phenomenon of interest to them, and then interview people who describe episodes from their lives in which these phenomena occurred. The students interpret these episodes and develop theories to account for their phenomena before searching for scholarly research on the topic.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Psychology (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "PSYC11H3 or PSYC12H3 or [PSYB10H3 plus one C-level half-credit in PSY]", "exclusions": "PSY420H", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["G Cupchik"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MW 223"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
