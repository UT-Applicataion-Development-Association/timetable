By systematically observing social milieux, conducting surveys, analyzing official statistics, inspecting historical documents, and carrying out experiments, they analyze the opportunities and constraints that help to make people what they are in different social contexts. This course introduces students to the sociological perspective and sociological approaches by investigating a wide range of human behaviours and institutions. Topics include social inequality, race and ethnicity, crime and deviance, families, the mass media, and gender and sexuality among others.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Sociology", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "SOC101Y1; SOC102H1; SOC103H1; SOCA01H3 + SOCA02H3; SOC100H5", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Summer F", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L5101", "instructors": ["J Hristov"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MP 102"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MP 102"}], "size": 150, "enrolment": 0}]}
