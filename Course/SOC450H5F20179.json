Topics will vary by instructor, but will often revolve around questions of punishment, prisons, and governance. Most class sessions will be held inside the institution (e.g., penitentiary, detention centre, halfway house, etc.). Inside and outside students will work together on small teams to develop and then present a final project. Students must apply per department instructions.
