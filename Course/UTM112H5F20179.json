Students will explore expression as social and cultural production, as intervention, and as a tool for social dialogue through assignments and small group activities that develop and refine key skills relevant to the humanities and social sciences. As part of this course students will participate in a series of tutorials that will introduce them to essential elements of a holistic student experience (such as career exploration, health and wellness, and co-curricular engagement).
