{"id": "ASTA01H3F20179", "code": "ASTA01H3F", "name": "Introduction to Astronomy and Astrophysics I: The Sun and Planets", "description": "The solar neighbourhood provides examples of astronomical bodies that can be studied by both ground-based and space vehicle based-observational instruments. The astronomical bodies studied range from cold and rocky planets and asteroids to extremely hot and massive bodies, as represented by the sun. This course considers astronomical bodies and their evolution, as well as basic parts of physics, chemistry, etc., required to observe them and understand their structure. The course is suitable for both science and non-science students.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "AST101H", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["K Menou"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SY 110"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SY 110"}], "size": 234, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 355"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0002", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 355"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0003", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 355"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0005", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "AC 334"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0006", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 355"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0007", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 355"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0004", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BV 355"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}]}
