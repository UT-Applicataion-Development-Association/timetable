{"id": "BIO422H5S20181", "code": "BIO422H5S", "name": "Plant Epigenetics", "description": "Plants show a remarkable plasticity that allows them to grow and survive in an ever-changing environment. Epigenetic mechanisms provide a fascinating layer of regulation that integrates the genome and environment. In addition, epigenetic marks can contribute to lasting effects that occur without changes in the underlying DNA sequence itself. This course explores how plant epigenomes respond to change such as stresses or developmental transitions. Influences on genome function, phenotype, and how epigenetic marks are transmitted will be discussed interactively drawing on recent primary literature and modern technological advances.
