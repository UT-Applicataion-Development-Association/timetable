{"id": "BIO477H5S20181", "code": "BIO477H5S", "name": "Molecular Biology of Gene Expression and Cancer", "description": "The first part of the course examines how genes are regulated in eukaryotic cells. It also explores the field of functional genomics and in particular examines how gene expression and genomes can be studied on a genome-wide basis using DNA microarrays and high throughput sequencing. The second part of the course examines the molecular and genetic basis of cancer including the role of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and cell cycle regulating proteins in the development of this disease. It also looks at cancer from a functional genomics perspective. Lectures and seminars involve presentation and discussion of recently published research articles.
