{"id": "BIOD22H3F20179", "code": "BIOD22H3F", "name": "Molecular Biology of the Stress Response", "description": "This course is organized around a central theme, namely the expression of heat shock (stress) genes encoding proteins is important in cellular repair/protective mechanisms. Topics include heat shock transcription factors, heat shock proteins as 'protein repair agents' that correct protein misfolding, and diseases triggered by protein misfolding such as neurodegenerative disorders.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Biological Sciences (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "BIOC10H3 or BIOC12H3 or BIOC15H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["I Brown"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "HW 408"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
