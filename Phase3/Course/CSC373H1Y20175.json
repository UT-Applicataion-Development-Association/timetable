Brief introduction to NP-completeness: polynomial time reductions, examples of various NP-complete problems, self-reducibility. Additional topics may include approximation and randomized algorithms. Students will be expected to show good design principles and adequate skills at reasoning about the correctness and complexity of algorithms.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Computer Science", "prerequisites": "CSC263H1/CSC265H1", "exclusions": "CSC375H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Summer Y", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L5101", "instructors": ["K Pal"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "RW 117"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "RW 117"}], "size": 140, "enrolment": 0}]}
