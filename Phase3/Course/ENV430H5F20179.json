There are many different instruments and tools which can be applied to environmental problems. Whether they are successful can depend on the political, policy, and legal context as well as the compatibility of the instrument chosen with the environmental problem it is directed at. This course will look at the \"toolbox\" of legal instruments and policy tools from both a theoretical and practical perspective. It will help students understand the advantages and disadvantages of the different options as well as how they can and are being used to deal with different environmental problems.
