Students are asked to complete assigned and self-directed projects, and may choose to consolidate and explore traditional print media, or to work with a combination of print and other two-dimensional, sculptural, or installation media of their choice. Increased refinement and sophistication in conception and execution is expected. Students become familiar with issues and examples of contemporary print practice, and discuss and critique works by contemporary artists.
