{"id": "FAS450Y5Y20179", "code": "FAS450Y5Y", "name": "Advanced Project", "description": "In this directed study, students undertake two semesters of independent research under the mentorship of a full-time Art and Art History studio faculty member. Students develop and present a body of artwork and a written and illustrated thesis for discussion, evaluation and critique. The course is modeled on a Master's thesis and as such provides the students with the experience needed to pursue Master of Fine Arts candidacy, their own art, and teaching careers. Advanced Project students must have a B+ standing in the fourth year of the studio discipline in which they intend to submit a proposal. A written proposal must be submitted to, and approved by, the department before registration.
