It also prompts students to think about photography and visual culture as both tools for documenting culinary practices and experiences, and as increasingly important adjuncts to contemporary food writing. The course is designed as a capstone offering in Food Studies, and as such, asks students to draw on their own expertise and awareness of food as a cultural vehicle to write in a compelling way about social dynamics, historical meaning, and - drawing specifically on the Scarborough experience - the diasporic imaginary.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Historical & Cultural Studies (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "FSTB01H3", "exclusions": "NULL", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MW 264"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
