It examines natural and anthropogenic origins of environmental change. Key methods and techniques used by physical geographers to study the Earth System are covered in lectures, readings, practical sessions and field work. Fieldwork is integral to all sub-disciplines of geography, and a major component of this course. There is no substitute for direct, hands-on exploration of the natural world.\u00a0This course fulfills 1 field day.\u00a0[24L, 12P]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Geography", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "GGR117Y5", "level": 100, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 2062"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 1}, {"code": "P0105", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 2062"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["T Porter"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "DV 2074"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "DV 2074"}], "size": 250, "enrolment": 17}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 2062"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 9}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 2062"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 2}, {"code": "P0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 2062"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 3}]}
