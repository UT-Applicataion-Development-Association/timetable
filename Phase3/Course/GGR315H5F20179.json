Watershed-scale hydrologic systems are investigated, along with basic principles of fluid mechanics. Open channel hydraulics, soil water, and groundwater processes are investigated. The importance of understanding water movement in the environment by exploring the relationship of hydrology to other environmental sciences is stressed.\u00a0This course fulfills 2 field days.\u00a0[24L, 36P]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Geography", "prerequisites": "GGR214H5/217H5", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 210"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 17}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "DV 2060"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 15}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "DV 2060"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 2}]}
