{"id": "HIS263Y5Y20179", "code": "HIS263Y5Y", "name": "The History of Canada", "description": "The department's most comprehensive survey of Canadian history, this course is designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of history students, those preparing to teach and others who want to benefit from a full lecture course and weekly tutorials. The first half of the course examines the French colony along the St. Lawrence River and its conquest by Great Britain. How did French culture survive? Political topics include Rebellions and Confederation. The course also explores the many peoples who arrived on our shores: stone-age hunters, French soldiers and brides, white and black Loyalists, and famine Irish; as well as later waves heading to eastern cities and western prairies. Twentieth century topics include modern social movements; the nation at war; popular culture; consumer society; and issues of Canadian identity. Lectures, debates and weekly tutorials help students master historical methods.
