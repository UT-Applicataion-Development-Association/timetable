While considerable reference will be made to \"high-income\" countries, the major emphasis will be on the health conditions of \"low-income\" countries -- as well as the interaction of these conditions with the international aid system. After setting the historical and political economy context, the course will explore key topics and themes in international/global health including: international health agencies and activities; data on health; epidemiology and the global distribution of health and disease; the societal determinants of health and social inequalities in health; health economics and the organization of health care systems in comparative context; globalization, trade, work, and health; health and the environment; the ingredients of healthy societies across the world; and Canada's/your/civil society's role in global health policy-making.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Centre for Critical Development Studies (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "5.0 full credits including IDSA01H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["A Birn"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MW 170"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "AC 334"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0002", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 72000, "duration": 3600, "location": "AC 334"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0003", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "AA 208"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0004", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 72000, "duration": 3600, "location": "AA 208"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
