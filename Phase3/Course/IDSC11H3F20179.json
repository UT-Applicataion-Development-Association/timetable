We begin with a reading and discussion seminar on international/global health policy and politics. (Exact topic changes each year based on student interest and developments in the field). Next, students develop group projects designed to raise awareness around particular global and international health problems, culminating in UTSC International Health Week in the Meeting Place. The third phase --which unfolds throughout the course-- involves individual research projects and class presentations.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Centre for Critical Development Studies (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "IDSA01H3 and IDSB04H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "AA 206"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
