Classic linear and non-linear codes. Error correcting and decoding properties. Cryptanalysis of classical ciphers from substitution to DES and various public key systems [e.g. RSA] and discrete logarithm based systems. Needed mathematical results from number theory, finite fields, and complexity theory are stated.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Computer & Mathematical Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "MATB24H3 and MATC15H3 and STAB52H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "IC 320"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "IC 120"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
