{"id": "MSE101H1F20175F", "code": "MSE101H1F2", "name": "Introduction to Materials Science", "description": "This is an introductory course in materials science examining the fundamentals of atomic structure, the nature of bonding in materials, crystal structure and defects, and phase equilibria. These basic principles provide the foundation for an exploration of structure-property relationships in metals, ceramics, and polymers, with emphasis on mechanical properties. The properties of materials then form the basis for an introduction to materials selection in design.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Engineering First Year Office", "prerequisites": "OAC/Grade 12 U Chemistry, Physics, and Calculus", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2017 Summer F", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1190"}], "size": 94, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": ""}], "size": 94, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Singh"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1190"}], "size": 94, "enrolment": 0}]}
