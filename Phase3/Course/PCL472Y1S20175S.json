Students will work under the supervision of a faculty member and will submit a final written report and oral presentation. Enrollment is limited and requires permission from the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology. It is the students responsibility to secure a placement with an approved supervisor before the course begins (a list of potential supervisors can be obtained from the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology). Students will be registered in the course once their ballot form (obtained from the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology) is signed by an approved supervisor and approved by the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology. Students are expected to spend approximately 200 hours towards this project but this will be project/supervisor dependent.
