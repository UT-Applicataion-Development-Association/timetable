{"id": "PHL285H5F20179", "code": "PHL285H5F", "name": "Philosophy of Art", "description": "A study of some of the most important philosophical questions about art. For example, what exactly is a work of art? Can any object whatsoever be, or become, an artwork? Who or what determines whether something is art? Does each person decide for themselves, or does a certain community (the \"art world\") decide? Can one interpretation or evaluation of a work be better, or more justified, than another? If so, how do we tell which one is better?", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Philosophy", "prerequisites": "PHL105Y5 (may be taken as a corequisite) or 4.0 credits.", "exclusions": "PHLB03H3", "level": 200, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "IB 335"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "IB 380"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 7}]}
