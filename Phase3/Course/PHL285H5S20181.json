{"id": "PHL285H5S20181", "code": "PHL285H5S", "name": "Philosophy of Art", "description": "A study of some of the most important philosophical questions about art. For example, what exactly is a work of art? Can any object whatsoever be, or become, an artwork? Who or what determines whether something is art? Does each person decide for themselves, or does a certain community (the \"art world\") decide? Can one interpretation or evaluation of a work be better, or more justified, than another? If so, how do we tell which one is better?", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Philosophy", "prerequisites": "PHL105Y5 (may be taken as a corequisite) or 4.0 credits.", "exclusions": "PHLB03H3", "level": 200, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2018 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": []}
