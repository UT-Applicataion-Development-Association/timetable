The first part of the course analyses states and state formation in historical perspective - examining the legacies of the late Ottoman and, in particular, the colonial period, the rise of monarchical states, the emergence of various forms of \"ethnic\" and/or \"quasi\" democracies, the onset of \"revolutions from above\", and the consolidation of populist authoritarian states. The second part of the course examines the resilience of the predominantly authoritarian state system in the wake of socio-economic and political reform processes.Area of Focus: Comparative Politics", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Political Science (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "POLB90H3 and [POLB91H3 or POLB92H3]", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2017 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["P Kingston"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MW 110"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
