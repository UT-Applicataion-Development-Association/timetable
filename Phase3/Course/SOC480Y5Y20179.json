{"id": "SOC480Y5Y20179", "code": "SOC480Y5Y", "name": "Experiential Learning", "description": "Through a part-time, unpaid individual or team work placement, students apply sociological knowledge gained primarily through previous course work. Placements may be made at municipal social service departments or non-profit agencies providing social services, social movement or community-based organizations working for social change, courts or parole offices, for-profit workplaces or other organizations. Students will learn how to plan and execute a real-world project. Placements will typically be tied to a specific project and students will be involved in developing the project's terms of engagement and deliverables. Students will normally write a report at the end of the course. The final report will demonstrate how the students' sociological knowledge related to a real life setting, and how their engagement with experiential learning shaped their academic knowledge. Specialists in Sociology and Criminology and Socio-Legal Studies will be given priority. An interview may be required.
