Students will participate and ultimately lead every aspect of designing and undertaking a comprehensive research program. This will include 1) designing a team-based interdisciplinary research project complete with a testable hypothesis subjected to state-of-the-art methodology and instrumentation, 2) gathering of primary, field-based data, 3) rigorous interpretation of the trends highlighted during data processing, and with the intention of 4) broad dissemination of the novel results through peer-review publishing. Each research team will learn and employ the Agile method of project management, which focuses on breaking up daunting research projects into a series of small manageable tasks to ensure successful project completion. As part of this course, students may have the option of participating in an international learning experience that will have an additional cost and application process. This is an application based course. Preference will be given to students who have previously completed a utmONE Scholars seminar.
